## AgencyAnalytics Frontend React Challenge!

Below are the pieces of technology that we have added into this repository for you with a little description.

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The whole app will be built on this, feel free to check out the docs!

[Vite](https://vite.dev/) is a popular build engine that is a standard these days and known for fast setup and build times. 

[PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/ ) this is the definitive API for all things Pokemon. You will be using this for all of our data during this challenge. So please dig in and give it a test, it doesnt require an API key so you can run api calls directly in browser to test out the responses. 

Mockup is located in the /mockup folder

### The challenge will have you build a fully functioning react application that is designed to be a a bit of a "pokedex"

There are two pages:

## Page 1 ##
The home page. As the mockup suggests there are all of the following on the home page:
- A search bar where you can search for Pokemon
- The home page is paginated
- The layout is quite simple as far as showing the pokemon and their images.
- Since this page is the home of the application it should also be performant

## Page 2 ##
The second page is a detail screen for the Pokemon, on this page we just show details about each pokemon. This page is quite simple implement it based on the mockup!

## Page 3 ##
Page three is not covered in the mockups but if you're feeling a bit extra we leave this page up to you if you'd like to add your own flare to the pokedex add this page and give us a small write up about why you added it and why it adds user value to your application. An opportunity to show us a bit of everything, development capabilities, design flare and also your product sense. 


### What to expect next ###

Be prepared and able to answer tough questions about your pokedex, we will expect you to know it inside and out, because you built it after all!
